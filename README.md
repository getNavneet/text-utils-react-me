## About the Project

Hey! I'm **Navneet**. I have been learning web development for a long time, and now I have almost completed it. Recently, I started building some projects. The projects I built earlier were based on tutorial guides, but this time, I started building from scratch. Yes, this is also inspired by a YouTube tutorial, but I built it myself.

I took about 2 weeks to build this project. In the first week, I spent an average of 4 hours per day, and in the second week, I worked around 6 hours a day, totaling 70 hours. Please note that the time span of two weeks was not continuous, meaning I was not consistent. There was a break of around 2 months. I started building this in May 2024, before my college summer break, and then I enjoyed my summer. I resumed this project in August 2024.

This is a completely open-source project. Go and clone the project from GitHub, and feel free to make contributions.

### Talking About the Difficulty of the Project

I think I can consider this a medium difficulty project. Beginners can also try building this kind of web app. This project can help you strengthen concepts like **useEffect, child component, parent component, navigation, NavLink, routing, popups, and carousel**.

### Difficulties I Faced

1. As I had started the code for this project 2 months ago, it took me 4-5 hours just to understand my previously written code.
2. The second major difficulty was making a header in which I have two linksâ€”one for home and another for a particular component in the home component. This was solved by referencing that element and making it scroll into view using `scrollIntoView`.
3. Selecting the right color so that the website looks good also consumed a lot of my time.
4. Generating a long random word was a challenge. If users generate a very long word like 2000-5000 characters, this was resolved by displaying only 100 words and then showing a "Show More" button.
